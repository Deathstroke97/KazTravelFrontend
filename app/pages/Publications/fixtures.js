    text_1: "<p>This means generally better standards of accommodation, restaurants and transport than elsewhere in Central Asia. The biggest city, Almaty, is almost reminiscent of Europe with its leafy avenues, chic ALZhiR Museum-Memorial Complex, glossy shopping centres and hedonistic nightlife.</p> <p>The capital Astana, on the windswept northern steppe, has been transformed into a 21st-century showpiece with a profusion of bold futuristic architecture. But it\'s beyond the cities that you\'ll find the greatest travel adventures, whether hiking in the high mountains and green valleys of the Tian Shan, searching for wildlife on the lake-dotted steppe, enjoying homespun hospitality in village guesthouses, or jolting across the western deserts to remote underground mosques.</p>",
    text_2: "<p>One of Kazakhstan’s most curious sights is the Buddhist rock carvings and paintings of bodhisattvas at Tamgaly Tas, (literally, ‘stones with signs’) found on the banks of the Ili River, 100 miles north of Almaty.</p><p> Britons hoping to visit Kazakhstan can do so without a visa for another year, it has been confirmed. Until December 31, 2018, UK travellers can stay for up to 30 days without the need for a trip to the Kazakh embassy in London.</p>",
    text_3: `<p>Stroll Nurzhol Bulvar to spot Astana’s most striking contemporary constructions. The architecture-exhibition boulevard runs between the impressive Ak Orda – the imposing, palatial building where the president works – and Khan Shatyr, a wacky off-centre tent-like structure and one  of Astana’s most incredible buildings.</p> <p>The centrepiece of Nurzhol Bulvar is the 97m-tall Bayterek Monument,  a white-latticed tower topped with a golden egg, a tribute to a Kazakh legend.  A lift whisks visitors to the top for unforgettable views of the city and buildings with clever local nicknames, such as the two gold conical ‘beer cans’ near Ak Orda, the blue-green rippling ‘Northern Lights’ skyscrapers, and the gleaming copper ‘cigarette lighter’ that houses the Transport and Communications Ministry.</p>`,
    content_4: `<h3>Hit the beach, indoors</h3>
        <p>The 150m-high, translucent Khan Shatyr is one of Astana’s most remarkable buildings. Designed by Norman Foster, it’s the largest marquee in the world. The structure is made of ethylene tetrafluoroethylene, a heat-absorbing material that keeps the temperature inside the marquee-cum-shopping-centre a balmy 20+ degrees, a tropical oasis in the depths of winter.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to shops spread across multiple floors, the Khan Shatyr features  a monorail and rides for kids, and the top floor has been turned into the exclusive Sky Beach Club, which has a:

          <li>Water slides and other</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thirty-five new hotels opened in Astana in the lead up to Expo 2017, and there are rooms for all budgets, from the 5-star Radisson, St Regis Astana (stregisastanaresidences.com) and Beijing Palace Soluxe (soluxe-astana.kz) to bona fide hostels such as Nomad Hostel and Apple Hostel, and a whole slew of mid-range hotels, such as Boutique Hotel Tomiriz at Kurgaldzhinskoye Hwy 9 and Tengri Hotel.</p>
